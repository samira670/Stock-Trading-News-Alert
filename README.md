This Python script utilizes APIs from Alpha Vantage for stock data and News API for news articles to provide timely updates on stock performance and related news for a specified company, exemplified by Tesla Inc (TSLA). It first retrieves the daily closing stock prices for the last two days and calculates the percentage change, subsequently fetching news articles if the change exceeds a 1% threshold. For each qualifying article, it formats the headline and description into separate messages, which are then sent as text messages to a designated phone number via the Twilio API. This integrated approach provides a concise yet informative means of staying informed about stock fluctuations and related news events.
